# About me

Hi, Iâ€™m @clemensGooooo.I'm interested in all programming stuff like Back-End, Front-End and applications and more.

#### What I already had done:
- Hacking/Cybersecurity, I did many CTF challenges and learned a lot in the learning paths I did on TryHackMe/HackTheBox and from amazing tutorials on YouTube. (CTF, THM, HTB, etc.)
- Worked with linux servers and Dockers, Containers, VMs -> Virtualisation
- Front-End, Back-End development with different languages... (Backend: FastAPI,Express.JS Frontend: React, Plain JS/HTML/CSS)
- AI with Python (tensorflow etc.)
- Website and Applications in JavaScript and Python with CSS,HTML and Markdown
- Worked with Arduino and ESP-Family and coded in C++, made some projects
- Worked on my self designed app (React Native, and Web App)
- Build different complex Electron apps with vite/react-ts, did some React (Made a task manager, which has more functions)
- Mobile development, worked with React-Native
- Made some games in Unity (2D mostly, easier)
- Docker, deployed some applications (Dockerfiles, CMD)
- Made some databases (mostly NoSQL like MongoDB, but sometimes SQL like: PostgreSQL,MySQL and some InfluxDB for ESP) 
- I have been using Linux, since I was a kid
- Websites were my intro into IT as a kid I developed them all my free time

Since 00000101 years I am programming!
